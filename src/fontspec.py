    The model is immutable (``frozen``) and validates the given font path:
    it ensures that the file exists, is a regular file, and has one of the
    supported extensions (``.ttf``, ``.otf``, ``.ttc``). The path is also
    normalized (via ``expanduser()`` and ``resolve()``) to avoid ambiguity
    across CI/CD environments and different platforms.

    Example
    -------
    ```python
    from pathlib import Path

    spec = FontSpec(
        name="Roboto-Light-Italic",
        file_path=Path("./fonts/Roboto-LightItalic.ttf"),

    # spec.file_path is now absolute and validated
